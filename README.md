# PoseEstimation
Hackathon Code


Project for Hackathon.

1. Run the requirements.txt to import all required libraries
2. Add video files to the root directory. 
3. Execute the frmAnalyse.py file
4. Browse the video and see the results in a separate window.
5. Close or press ctrl+C to exit.

This is still in development mode. So error handling is not done. 

Thanks for reading.
